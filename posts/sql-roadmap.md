# SQL Roadmap — From Basics to Advanced in 4 Steps

SQL (Structured Query Language) has been around for decades, but it’s still one of the most in-demand skills in tech. Whether you’re starting out as a data analyst, growing into a data engineer, or even stepping into product and solution architecture, **SQL is the language that unlocks your data**.

When I started, SQL felt intimidating — full of strange keywords and syntax. But once I broke it into steps, it became manageable and even fun. Here’s the **4-step roadmap** I wish I had when I began.

## Step 1. Fundamentals — Learn to Speak SQL

Think of this as learning to introduce yourself in a new language. At this stage, you’ll be writing simple queries that get you familiar with how SQL “talks” to databases.

Key concepts:
- **SELECT**: choose the columns you want
- **FROM**: tell SQL which table to look at
- **WHERE**: filter rows by conditions
- **ORDER BY**: sort results by a column
- **LIMIT**: control how many rows you see

👉 Example:

SELECT id, name, country
FROM customers
WHERE country = 'India'
ORDER BY name
LIMIT 20;
